            <h3>‘The King’s Man’ and ‘No Time to Die’ are weak on issues of cultural awareness</h3>
            <p1>‘There has perhaps been no better barometer of British establishment values in the twentieth century than the James Bond movies. Now one of the world’s longest-running film series since Dr No in 1962, Bond is a cultural institution that has captivated the imaginations of thousands, and has become synonymous not just with the spy genre, but a broader sense of what it means to be “British”.’</p1>

            <h3>The Future is Nuclear: The Nuclear Power Debate and COP26</h3>
            <p1>‘There are advantages to nuclear power plants that renewable sources of energy do not have. While they are costly and time-consuming, they take up comparatively little space compared to their energy output. Wind and solar require vast tracts of land to reach anywhere near the output of a nuclear power plant, including the space needed for batteries in which to store the energy.’</p1>

            <h3>Meet the students pushing for ‘Sustainable Sex’</h3>
            <p1>‘In response to the worldwide demand to reduce carbon emissions and plastic waste, a group of University of Exeter students has begun to campaign for greater sustainability in an area of life that some may not have considered to be a threat to the environment: sex. “The whole of the UK is looking to be greener about transport and food, and the sex industry is too, but it’s a bit of a taboo subject so no-one really wants to talk about it”, said Matilda Money-Kyrle, one of the five team members of Sustainable Sex, an Instagram page dedicated to promoting eco-friendly sex products.’</p1>

            <p1>‘For so many people, Halloween is a time for creativity and self-expression: the best outfits are ones that their creators have clearly put a lot of time, energy, and imagination into. However, every year there are a couple of completely unoriginal costumes that get endlessly recycled by party-goers. Here are my predictions for what this year’s most popular costumes are going to be.’</p1>

            <p1>‘With its Jubilee bathing pool and views over the historic St Michael’s Mount, Penzance isn’t the first place you might expect to encounter online culture. However, as the Exchange’s “Outside the Algorithm” exhibition highlights, the internet is both nowhere and everywhere, even in the furthest reaches of the UK’s most southern county. Although only a short experience, if you’re visiting Penzance there’s no real reason not to have a look around, especially as students are permitted free entry.’</p1>

            <p1>‘In August, the administrators of the popular student Facebook page Penfession announced that they intended to close the page at the end of the month, officially ceasing operations last week. A Penryn-based version of the common university “fession” (short for confession) page, Penfession had amassed over 4,000 followers since its creation in January 2019. Following the announcement of its closure, a new team established a successor to the original page, Penfession II: The Swimming Pool Notice Board. The Anchor reached out to the administrators to ask them some questions.’</p1>

Although the series’ previous episodes had been met with critical acclaim, the response to episode seven resulted in #fuming trending on twitter for hours after the episode concluded. To summarise: for the past three series, the AC12 anti-corruption unit had been investigating the identity of a figure named ‘H’, a corrupt senior police officer working with organised crime, and in this final episode the identity of ‘H’ had been revealed.’</p1>

            <p1>‘A black hoodie. A loaded rifle. Upturned tables and empty halls. The tropes of an American school shooting are so recognisable that they border on cliché. Since the massacre at Columbine twenty-two years ago, this imagery has appeared ubiquitously in the news, provoking feelings of terror, disgust, and resentment. So why has The Daily Wire, prolific conservative news network, chosen the first exclusive movie on its digital streaming service to be about such a volatile topic?’</p1>

Thanks to non-profits such as Fashion Revolution, knowledge about the unfair treatment of clothing industry workers is gaining currency.

            <p1>‘Over a month has now passed since the US election, arguably one of the most consequential and important elections of the 21st century, particularly for the West. Since the election, broadcast hours and column inches have been filled with pundits and commentators offering their takeaways and opinions of what demographic trends say about the changing nature of American society, the divisions that these changes have caused, and the electoral impacts that result from these divisions. Now that some time has passed, however, electoral reports and post-election studies reveal a new depth of data, from which we can conduct a reasoned and detailed analysis of the election, focusing on two distinct factors: youth participation and urban-rural divisions.’</p1>

This is no more true of the music industry. Even though music streaming does not necessitate being close to other people the same way going to the cinema or the theatre does, predicting which music gets popular has been made almost impossible by the virus. ’</p1>
